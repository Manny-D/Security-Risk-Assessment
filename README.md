# Capstone: Security Risk Assessment

## Description
For this project, I leveraging insights from the completed [Audit Lab](https://github.com/Manny-D/Audit-Lab). I conducted a comprehensive risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen an organization's data security posture.


 ### Key Points
 - <b>Risk Mitigation</b>: Develop documented strategies to address risks identified during audits, aligning with NIST SP 800-53 controls MP-1 through MP-8 (Media Protection).
 - <b>Risk Prioritization</b>: Objectively assess and prioritize risks based on a quantifiable framework (e.g., NIST SP 800-30), ensuring clear communication to stakeholders for proactive risk management.
 - <b>Frameworks</b>: Leverage assessment scales from NIST SP 800-30 to establish a quantifiable approach for risk identification and prioritization.


### Objectives
  - <b>Analyze Risks</b>: Integrate threat modeling results with existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and System Security Plan (SSPs) to comprehensively assess organizational risks.
  - <b>Communicate Risks Effectively</b>: Tailor risk explanations to be understandable by non-technical audiences.
  - <b>Mitigate Risks Proactively</b>: Develop and implement strategies to address identified risks.

## Step 1: Understanding Control Status  
After reviewing [NIST SP 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), I determined the control MP-1 (Media Protection Policy and Procedures) was not in place.

Based on the interview with Director of IT, John Connor, the review of the SOP and SSP, and the threat modeling conducted prior to the audit, I determined that the biggest risk for not having Media Protection policies and procedures in place is unauthorized access.

## Step 2: Identifying Mitigating Factors 
From the evidence I gathered in the interview, I can say that a mitigating factor for this risk is "Tribal knowledge in place" for people within the organization.

## Step 3: Quantitative Risk Assessment
I then used [NIST SP 800-30](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) assessment scales for quantitative determination of impact and likelihood of this risk. Understanding these values allows me to consistently determine the risk for each control.

Using these values, I can objectively determine that the likelihood of unauthorized access would be a 5 (low), and the impact if it were to happen would also be a 5 (low); the overall impact for this risk is 25/100 (low).

## Step 4: Objective Risk Explanation 
My objective, defensible explanation for this risk: "Staff do not know what expectations or standards are, and no process around media protection, storage, or sanitization is documented, so may not be done properly. Without standards and policy, no process can be repeated consistently, and staff will develop their own individual processes."

## Step 5: Repetition for Each Control
After completing the risk assessment for Media Access control MP-1, I repeated steps 1-4 for controls MP-2 through MP-8.

## Step 6: Prioritizing Risks
I then sorted the spreadsheet by overall risk to prioritize the controls that have the highest risk.

Now that I had an organized list of the risks, I created an executive report to effectively communicate the risks with the organization.

## Optional Step: Mitigation Recommendations 
The risk assessment can be further enhanced by incorporating mitigation strategies for identified risks.  If the organization offers relevant solutions, I can recommend their inclusion, adding practical value to the assessment.
